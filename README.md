# ttgo-lora32 ttnmapper with gps

This is a modified version of the [esp32-ttnmapper-gps](https://github.com/ricaun/esp32-ttnmapper-gps) for compilation with [platformio](https://platformio.org/) currently only matched to the EU868 frequency.

This Program sends the Location gathered by a GPS connected via serial port to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). The Location can be viewed on the [ttnmapper](http://ttnmapper.org/) when the [integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/ttnmapper/) is activated.
